# Summary

One thing I did not do today that I'd prefer to have done is review the TODO list and formulate a plan for the day first thing in the morning.

Around 16:15 I switched to studying Fleming. I was looking at the first proposition on p. 86, but quickly realized that it followed immediately from the chain rule, so I had another session studying the chain rule and trying to intuitively understand it. After some effort trying to get the correct statement of the chain rule via "type-checking", I attempted to do two things:

 1. specialize it to a composition $g \circ f$ where $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ and $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. Here we have the case where the derivatives of $f$ and $g$ are tangent plane and tangent line, respectively.

 2. Prove it using the infinitesimal approach, $D[g @ a](\epsilon) = g(a + \epsilon) - g(a)$ for all "infinitesimal vectors" $\epsilon$.

I also came up with slightly more compact notation for representing it. 

TODO: None of the notes just mentioned are in the computer yet. So get on that

I am studying Fleming, starting at p. 86 (skipping recording the proof of diff. @ a => cont. @ a for now. Also skippig the example that follows in the book).

I ended up studying just the center of mass out of Beutler and independently. These notes are not on the computer yet.

I spent some time working out my intuition with the center of mass. I got confused because there are scalar multiples $C \sum_0^n m_i x_i(t)$ with $C \neq \frac{1}{M}$ that are convex combinations of $x_i(t)$'s. What makes them not useful is that the same $C$ doesn't work for all $t$, I believe, unless $C = \frac{1}{M}$.

I am now up to p. 56 in Beutler.

I was reading 3.2, hit the part about the heliocentric diff-eqns being representable as the gradient of some functions and got confused. I then tried to skip to 4.1 on the Two-body problem, but that used material from ch 3 (angular momentum).

So, instead I'm going to skip the gradient stuff and proceed to 3.2.2, "First Integrals". I also see that this gets into the virial theorem, which I've heard of before and look forward to reading about.
